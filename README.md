# Project Overview

“What mental health needs is more sunlight, more candor, and more unashamed conversation.”
— Glenn Close

## Motivation

We wanted to decrease the likelyhood of UNC Charlotte students dropping out.

## What it does

Mysa gets the users' mood for the day and allows them to express it in their virtual journal/diary. It also gives students resources for if they are struggling with mental health. And gives them a generated playlist on spotify based on their mood.

## How we built it

We built Mysa using the MERN stack.

## Challenges

Most of us had little to no experience building a project using the MERN stack
